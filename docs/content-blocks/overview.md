# Content Blocks

*Overview of the content block system and common functionality*

Content blocks are modular components used to build pages in the Content tab of entries. Instead of a single text editor, you combine different block types to create flexible page layouts. Each block handles specific content types with their own fields and design options.

## Adding Content Blocks

Content blocks are added in the Content tab when editing entries.
