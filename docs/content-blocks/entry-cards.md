## How Entry Cards Work

### Automatic Mode

When **Automatic** is selected:

**With "Show Current Entry's Own Children" enabled:**
- Displays all child entries of the current page
- Each child becomes a card with its title, excerpt, and featured image
- Links directly to the child entry
- Perfect for parent pages showing sub-pages

**With "Show Current Entry's Own Children" disabled:**
- Uses manually selected entries from an entries field
- If only one entry is selected, shows that entry's children
- If multiple entries are selected, shows all selected entries as cards

### Custom Mode

When **Custom** is selected:
- Allows manual configuration of each card
- Can use entry details (title, excerpt, featured image) or custom content
- More control over card appearance and content
- Can mix different entry types in the same card set

### Card Content Sources

**From linked entries:**
- **Title** – Uses the entry's title or custom link text
- **Text** – Uses the entry's excerpt or summary
- **Image** – Uses the entry's featured image
- **Link** – Links to the entry's URL

**Custom content:**
- **Custom headings** – Override entry titles with custom text
- **Custom descriptions** – Replace excerpts with specific text
- **Custom images** – Use different images than the entry's featured image
- **Custom links** – Link to different destinations

## Usage

Use Entry Cards for:
- **Navigation aids** – Help visitors discover related content
- **Parent/child relationships** – Show sub-pages on main category pages
- **Related content** – Display relevant articles or services at the end of pages
- **Homepage highlights** – Feature key content or services
- **Category pages** – Show all items within a specific category

The "Show Current Entry's Own Children" option is particularly useful for automatically maintaining navigation on pages that have sub-pages, as it updates automatically when child pages are added or removed.
