# FAQ

*Expandable question and answer sections*

The FAQ block creates accordion-style question and answer sections. It offers both global and local content options, allowing you to use consistent site-wide FAQs or create page-specific questions, with automatic SEO schema markup generation.

## Global vs Local Content

### Global FAQ

- Useful for standard questions that apply site-wide

- Can improve search result visibility with rich snippets

### Local FAQ

## When to Use Each Option

**Use Global FAQs for:**
- Standard company questions that apply across multiple pages
- Product or service questions that don't change
- General inquiry FAQs used throughout the site
- Consistent messaging that should remain centralized

**Use Local FAQs for:**
- Page-specific questions relevant to particular content
- Service-specific FAQ sections
- Topic-focused questions for specialized pages
- Custom FAQ sections that don't apply site-wide

## FAQ Behavior Options

**Open first item automatically:**
- First question starts expanded when the page loads
- Helps immediately show visitors there's content available
- Useful when the first question is most important or commonly asked

**All items stay open:**
- Multiple questions can be expanded simultaneously
- Visitors can compare answers or read multiple sections
- Better for comprehensive FAQ sections
- When disabled, opening one question closes others (accordion behavior)

## SEO Schema Benefits

**Output FAQPage Schema** generates structured data that:
- Helps search engines understand your FAQ content
- Can display FAQ rich snippets in search results
- Improves visibility for question-based searches
- Follows Google's FAQPage structured data guidelines
- Automatically formats questions and answers for search engines

## Usage

FAQ blocks work well:
- **On service pages** – Address common questions about specific offerings
- **In support sections** – Provide self-service help for customers
- **On product pages** – Answer questions that help with purchase decisions
- **At the end of content** – Address questions raised by the main content

The schema markup option is particularly valuable for pages where you want FAQ content to appear in search results as rich snippets.
