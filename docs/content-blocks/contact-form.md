# Contact Form

*Add contact and inquiry forms to your pages*

The Contact Form block provides inquiry forms with spam protection and email notifications. It offers both global and local options, allowing you to use a consistent site-wide form or create page-specific forms.

## Global vs Local Content

### Global Contact Form
