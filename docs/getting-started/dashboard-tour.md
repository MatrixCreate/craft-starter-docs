# Control Panel Tour

Let's take a detailed tour of your Craft CMS dashboard to understand how everything is organized.

## Main Navigation

The left sidebar contains your main navigation, organized into logical sections:

### Entries Section
This is where you'll spend most of your time managing content:

[Screenshot: Entries section expanded showing Collections, Content, System]

- **Singles**: Special one-off pages
  - Homepage

- **Collections**: Groups of content typically used in other sections of the site
  - Blog posts and articles
  - Team member profiles
  - Customer testimonials
  
- **Content**: Primary content pages
  - About, Services, Contact pages
  - All your site's main content

- **System**: Technical pages
  - Blog categories
  - 404 error pages
  - Maintenance pages

### Global Settings
Three important sections for site-wide management:

  - Site-wide call-to-action sections
  - Contact forms
  - FAQ sections
  - Testimonials
  - Newsletter signups

## Working with Entries

### Entry List View
When you click on any content type, you'll see a list of entries:

[Screenshot: Entry list showing pages with titles, status, and dates]

- **Title**: The name of your page or post
- **Status**: Draft, Published, or Scheduled
- **Date**: When it was created or last modified
- **Actions**: Edit, duplicate, or delete entries

### Entry Groups
Notice how entries are organized into logical groups rather than the generic "Posts" and "Pages" you might be used to from other systems.

## Content Editing Interface

When you edit any entry, you'll see multiple tabs:

[Screenshot: Entry editing interface showing Content, Hero, Footer Content, SEO, Schema tabs]

### Main Tabs:
- **Content**: Your main page content (content blocks)
- **Hero**: Page header section
- **Footer Content**: Page-specific footer elements
- **SEO**: Search engine optimization settings
- **Schema**: Structured data for search engines

## Quick Actions

### Search
Use the search bar to quickly find any content:

- Search by title, content, or author
- Filter by content type
- Find entries across all sections

### User Menu
In the top right corner, access your account settings:

- Change password
- Sign out

## Navigation Tips

### Breadcrumbs
Always know where you are in the system:

### Back Button
Your browser's back button works normally - use it to navigate between sections.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl/Cmd + S**: Save your work
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Enter**: Save and continue editing

## Organization Logic

The dashboard is organized by **content type** rather than **format**:

**Traditional CMS**: Posts vs Pages
**Craft CMS**: Collections vs Content vs System

This makes it easier to find and manage related content together.

## What's Different from WordPress?

### No "Posts" and "Pages"
Everything is an "Entry" but organized by purpose:
- Blog content goes in "Collections"
- Main site pages go in "Content"
- Technical pages go in "System"

### Two-Level Global Settings
Instead of one "Settings" area:
- **Site Config**: Technical site settings
- **Global Content**: Reusable content elements

### Content Block System
Instead of a single content editor, you build pages with content blocks (more on this in [Your First Edit](first-edit.md)).

## Getting Comfortable

### Start Here:
1. **Browse the Entries**: Click through Collections, Content, and System
2. **Check Global Settings**: Look at Site Config and Global Content
3. **Open an existing page**: See how content is structured
4. **Try the search**: Find content quickly

### Next Steps:

- [Global Settings](/global-settings/) - Manage site-wide content
