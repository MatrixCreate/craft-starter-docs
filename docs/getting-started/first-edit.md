# Your First Edit

Let's walk through editing a page step-by-step. This tutorial will show you the basics of working with content in Craft CMS.

## Step 1: Choose a Page to Edit

We'll start by editing an existing page to understand the interface.

![Entries > Content > Pages list](./screenshots/013.png)

1. Click **Entries** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Content** to expand the section
3. Click **Pages** to see your site's main pages
4. Click on any page title to open it for editing

## Step 2: Understanding the Editing Interface

Once you open a page, you'll see several tabs at the top:

### The Content Tab
This is where you'll do most of your work. The **Content** tab contains your page's main content using our content block system.

## Step 3: Working with Content Blocks

### What Are Content Blocks?
Instead of one large text editor, content is built using "blocks" - individual pieces of content that you can arrange and customize.

### Available Block Types:
- **Text**: Rich text content (headings, paragraphs, lists)
- **Text & Image**: Combine text with images
- **Call to Action**: Buttons and promotional sections
- **Contact Form**: Contact and inquiry forms
- **FAQ**: Question and answer sections
- **Video**: Embedded videos
- **And more...**

### Adding Your First Block

1. Click **+ Add Content Block** at the bottom
2. Choose **Text** from the list
3. A new text block will appear

2. Type or paste your content
3. Use the toolbar to format text (bold, italic, lists, etc.)
4. Add links by selecting text and clicking the link button

### Adding Images

![Image upload interface showing "Add an image", "Upload a file", and "Search" options](./screenshots/019.png)

1. Click the image icon in the text editor
2. Choose **Add an image** to upload a new file
3. Or choose **Search** to find existing images
4. Select your image and click **Insert**

### Color Controls
Many blocks have color options:

![Color controls showing Heading Colour, Text Colour, Background Colour options](./screenshots/020.png)

- **Heading Colour**: Changes the color of headings in this block
- **Text Colour**: Changes the color of body text
- **Background Colour**: Changes the block's background color

## Step 5: Saving Your Work

### Save Options
At the top right of the page:

![Save button and options](./screenshots/021.png)

- **Save**: Saves your changes as a draft
- **Save and continue editing**: Saves and stays on the page
- **Save and add another**: Saves and creates a new entry

### Publishing
Your changes won't appear on the live site until you publish:

![Publishing options showing Live, Disabled, Pending status](./screenshots/022.png)

1. Set the status to **Live** to publish
2. Or keep as **Disabled** to save as a draft
3. You can schedule publication for later

## Step 6: Preview Your Changes

Before publishing, preview your changes:

![Preview button or live preview option](./screenshots/023.png)

1. Click **Preview** to see how your page will look
2. Open the preview in a new tab
3. Check that everything looks correct

## Step 7: Understanding Global vs Local Content

Some content blocks offer **Global** vs **Local** options:

![Global vs Local toggle in a content block](./screenshots/024.png)

- **Global**: Uses site-wide content (managed in Global Settings)
- **Local**: Creates page-specific content

For example:
- **Global FAQ**: Shows the same questions on every page
- **Local FAQ**: Creates unique questions for this page only

## Common First-Time Tasks

2. Click in the text area
3. Edit the content
