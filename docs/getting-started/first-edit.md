# Your First Edit

Let's walk through editing a page step-by-step. This tutorial will show you the basics of working with content in Craft CMS.

## Step 1: Choose a Page to Edit

We'll start by editing an existing page to understand the interface.

[Screenshot: Entries > Content > Pages list]

1. Click **Entries** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Content** to expand the section
3. Click **Pages** to see your site's main pages
4. Click on any page title to open it for editing

## Step 2: Understanding the Editing Interface

Once you open a page, you'll see several tabs at the top:

### The Content Tab
This is where you'll do most of your work. The **Content** tab contains your page's main content using our content block system.

## Step 3: Working with Content Blocks

### What Are Content Blocks?
Instead of one large text editor, content is built using "blocks" - individual pieces of content that you can arrange and customize.

### Available Block Types:
- **Text**: Rich text content (headings, paragraphs, lists)
- **Text & Image**: Combine text with images
- **Call to Action**: Buttons and promotional sections
- **Contact Form**: Contact and inquiry forms
- **FAQ**: Question and answer sections
- **Video**: Embedded videos
- **And more...**

### Adding Your First Block

1. Click **+ Add Content Block** at the bottom
2. Choose **Text** from the list
3. A new text block will appear

- **Background Colour**: Changes the block's background color

## Step 5: Saving Your Work

### Save Options
At the top right of the page:

[Screenshot: Save button and options]

- **Save**: Saves your changes as a draft
- **Save and continue editing**: Saves and stays on the page
- **Save and add another**: Saves and creates a new entry

### Publishing
Your changes won't appear on the live site until you publish:

[Screenshot: Publishing options showing Live, Disabled, Pending status]

1. Set the status to **Live** to publish
2. Or keep as **Disabled** to save as a draft
3. You can schedule publication for later

## Step 6: Preview Your Changes

Before publishing, preview your changes:

[Screenshot: Preview button or live preview option]

1. Click **Preview** to see how your page will look
2. Open the preview in a new tab
3. Check that everything looks correct

## Step 7: Understanding Global vs Local Content

Some content blocks offer **Global** vs **Local** options:

- **Global**: Uses site-wide content (managed in Global Settings)
- **Local**: Creates page-specific content

For example:
- **Global FAQ**: Shows the same questions on every page
- **Local FAQ**: Creates unique questions for this page only
