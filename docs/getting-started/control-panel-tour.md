# Control Panel Tour

*Getting familiar with the Craft CMS interface and navigation*

The Control Panel is your workspace for managing all website content. Rather than diving deep into specific features, this tour shows you where everything is located and how the interface is organized.

## Main Navigation

The left sidebar contains your main navigation, organized into logical sections:

### Entries Section
This is where you'll spend most of your time managing content:

## Working with Entries

![Entry list showing pages with titles, status, and dates](./screenshots/006.png)

- **Title**: The name of your page or post
- **Status**: Draft, Published, or Scheduled
- **Date**: When it was created or last modified
- **Actions**: Edit, duplicate, or delete entries

### Content Organization
Entries are organized by purpose and content type rather than generic categories, making it easier to find related content.

## Content Editing Interface

When you edit any entry, you'll see multiple tabs:

![Entry editing interface showing Content, Hero, Card Details, Footer Content, SEO, Schema tabs](./screenshots/007.png)

### Main Tabs:

- **Hero**: Page header section

- **SEO**: Search engine optimization settings
- **Schema**: Structured data for search engines

## Quick Actions

### Search
Use the search bar to quickly find any content:

## Navigation Tips

### Breadcrumbs
Always know where you are in the system:

![Breadcrumb navigation](./screenshots/010.png)

### Back Button
Your browser's back button works normally - use it to navigate between sections.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl/Cmd + S**: Save your work
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Enter**: Save and continue editing

## Interface Organization

The Control Panel groups related functionality together rather than separating by content format. This organizational approach helps you find tools and content based on what you're trying to accomplish.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the Control Panel layout:

1. **Explore the sections** - Click through Entries, Global Settings, and other areas
2. **Try the search** - Use it to find specific content quickly  
3. **Open an existing entry** - See how content editing works
4. **Ready to edit?** - Continue to [Your First Edit](first-edit.md)
