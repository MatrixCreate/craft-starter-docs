# Creating New Pages

Creating a new page in Craft CMS is a straightforward process. This guide will walk you through the steps from creation to building out your content.

## 1. Create the New Entry

First, you need to create the page entry itself:

1.  Navigate to **Entries** in the main sidebar.
2.  Select the appropriate section for your new page (e.g., **Content → Pages** for a standard page or **Collections → Blog** for a new blog post).
3.  Click the **+ New entry** button in the top-right corner.

## 2. Add the Title

The very first thing you should do is give your page a **Title**. The title is the main heading for your page and is also used to automatically create the page's URL (or "slug").

## 3. Build Your Content

With the title in place, you can now build the body of your page using the block-based editor in the **Content** tab.

1.  Scroll down to the **Content** section.
2.  Click the **+ Add a block** button to open the list of available content blocks.
3.  Select the block you want to add (e.g., a `Text` block for paragraphs, or a `Text & Image` block for a mixed layout).
4.  Fill in the fields for that block.
5.  Continue adding blocks in the order you want them to appear on the page. You can always reorder them later by dragging and dropping.

## 4. Fill in Other Tabs

Once your main content is in place, click through the other tabs at the top of the editor to add the finishing touches:

-   **Hero**: Add a compelling header image and title for the top of your page.
-   **Card Details**: Add the image and excerpt that will be used when this page is featured in lists elsewhere on the site.
-   **SEO**: Fine-tune the page's title and meta description for search engines.

## 5. Save and Publish

When you are ready, you can save your work using the buttons in the top-right corner. See the [Publishing Workflow](publishing.md) guide for a detailed explanation of the different saving and publishing options.
