# Footer Navigation

*Managing secondary navigation in the site footer*

## Footer Navigation Purpose

Footer Navigation manages the secondary menu structure that appears in the website footer, typically containing supporting pages and links that complement the main navigation.

## Navigation Structure

### Typical Footer Content
- **Company Information** - About pages, team, contact details
- **Service Links** - Secondary service pages and specializations  
- **Legal Pages** - Privacy policy, terms of service, disclaimers
- **Resource Links** - FAQs, guides, useful information
- **External Links** - Social media, partner sites, certifications

### Organization Principles
- **Supporting Role** - Complement rather than duplicate main navigation
- **User Expectations** - Include standard footer elements users expect to find
- **SEO Value** - Provide additional internal linking opportunities
- **Accessibility** - Ensure footer navigation remains accessible and functional

## Management Interface

The Footer Navigation uses the same interface structure as Main Navigation:
- **Hierarchical display** showing menu organization
- **Entry and Passive node types** for flexible structure
- **Drag-and-drop reordering** for easy organization
- **Sidebar panels** for adding different content types

### Adding Footer Items

**Entry Selection** - Link to existing content pages
**Custom URLs** - Add external links to partners, social media, or third-party resources
**Passive Groups** - Create sections within footer for better organization

## Footer Navigation Strategy

### Content Planning
- **Identify secondary pages** that don't belong in main navigation
- **Group related items** for easier scanning and use
- **Consider user journey** - what information do users seek in footers?
- **Balance comprehensiveness** with simplicity

### Common Footer Sections
- **Company** - About, team, careers, contact
- **Services** - Additional service areas, specializations
- **Resources** - FAQ, blog, guides, tools
- **Legal** - Privacy, terms, accessibility, cookies
- **Connect** - Social media, newsletter, contact methods

The Footer Navigation provides valuable secondary navigation that enhances user experience without cluttering the primary navigation structure.
