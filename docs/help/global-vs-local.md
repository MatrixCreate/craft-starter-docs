# Global vs Local Content

*Understanding the core concept of content management in Craft CMS*

## The Fundamental Concept

### Global Content
- Content that appears across multiple pages
- Managed in one central location
- Changes affect all pages using that content
- Examples: contact forms, testimonials, FAQs, USPs

### Local Content
- Content specific to individual pages
- Managed on each page separately
- Changes only affect that specific page
- Examples: page-specific text, unique images, custom CTAs

## When to Use Each

### Use Global When:
- Content should be consistent across the site
- You want to update multiple pages at once
- Managing testimonials, FAQs, or contact forms
- Maintaining brand consistency

### Use Local When:
- Content is unique to a specific page
- You need page-specific messaging
- Creating custom calls-to-action
- Tailoring content to specific audiences

## Managing Global Content

### Location
- Found in Global Settings â†’ Global Content
- Organized into content types (CTA, FAQ, USPs, etc.)
- Centralized management interface

### Editing Process
- Edit once in Global Settings
- Changes automatically appear on all pages using that content
- No need to update individual pages

## WordPress Comparison

### WordPress Approach

- Widgets provide some global functionality
- Most content is page-specific
- Plugins required for advanced global content

### Craft CMS Advantage
- Built-in global content management
- Flexible global/local switching
- Better content consistency
- Easier site-wide updates
