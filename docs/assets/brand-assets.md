# The Brand Assets Volume

The **Brand Assets** volume is a specialized repository for your company's core visual identity materials, primarily your logos. Unlike the main `Images` volume, the files here are not intended for day-to-day content editing.

## Purpose of Brand Assets

This volume is designed to be a **set-it-and-forget-it** library. The logos and other brand materials stored here are automatically used by the system in key places across the website, such as:

-   The main site header
-   The website footer
-   Email templates
-   Other system-generated communications

Because these assets are tied directly to your site's global settings, they are managed by administrators or developers during the initial site setup. As a content editor, you will typically not need to upload, edit, or interact with the files in this volume.

## What to Know as an Editor

-   **No Action Needed**: You do not need to select logos from this volume when building pages. The system automatically places the correct logos where they belong.
-   **Centralized Control**: If a company logo ever needs to be updated, it is changed once in the `Brand Assets` volume, and the update will be reflected site-wide. This ensures brand consistency without any manual effort from editors.

*The `Brand Assets` volume is a protected space for core brand materials. As an editor, you can rely on it to work automatically without needing to manage it yourself.*
