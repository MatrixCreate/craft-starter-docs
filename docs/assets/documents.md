# The Documents Volume

The **Documents** volume is designed specifically for hosting files that you intend for visitors to download. This is the place for PDFs, Word documents, or other files that aren't images but need to be accessible to the public from your website.

## Purpose of the Documents Volume

Use this volume to store and manage files such as:

-   **Restaurant Menus**: A downloadable PDF of your latest menu.
-   **Product Catalogues**: Detailed brochures or spec sheets for your products.
-   **Application Forms**: Printable forms for job applications or service sign-ups.
-   **Informational Guides**: White papers, case studies, or how-to guides.

When you link to a file from this volume in your content (for example, in a `Text` block or an `Action Button`), the system will automatically display it as a downloadable link, often including the file size and type for the user's convenience.

## Managing Documents

Uploading and managing documents follows the same process as for images:

1.  Select the **Documents** volume in the left sidebar.
2.  Click the **Upload files** button to add a new document.
3.  Click on an existing document to edit its **Title**. Giving it a clear, descriptive title (e.g., "Spring 2025 Dinner Menu") is more user-friendly than the filename (`menu_v3_final.pdf`).

Unlike images, documents do not require alt text, as they are typically downloaded rather than displayed on the page.
