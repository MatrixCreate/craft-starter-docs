# Managing Assets

The **Assets** section in Craft CMS is your central library for all media files, including images, documents, and brand materials. Unlike a single media library, assets are organized into **Volumes**, which are like separate folders each with a specific purpose. This structure helps keep files organized and makes it easy to find what you need.

## What You'll Learn

-   The concept of **Asset Volumes** and why they are used.
-   The specific purpose of the main volumes: **Images**, **Brand Assets**, and **Documents**.
-   How to upload and manage your media files effectively.
