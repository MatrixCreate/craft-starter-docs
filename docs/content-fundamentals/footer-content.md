# Page-Specific Footer Content

While most of your website's footer is managed globally to ensure consistency, Craft CMS provides a **Footer Content** tab that allows you to add page-specific content to the footer area of an individual entry. This is useful for adding relevant links, calls to action, or disclaimers that apply only to the page being viewed.

This local footer content appears *above* the main global footer.

## The Footer Content Tab

When editing any entry, you can find the **Footer Content** tab alongside the other main editing tabs like Content and Hero.

## How It Works

The Footer Content tab works just like the main Content tab: it's a block-based editor where you can add any available content block. This gives you the flexibility to build out a unique footer section for any page.

### Common Use Cases

-   **Related Links**: Add an `Entry Cards` block to link to other relevant pages or blog posts that don't belong in the main content.
-   **Special Offers**: Use a `Call to Action` block to promote a special offer that is directly related to the content of the current page.
-   **Legal Disclaimers**: Add a `Text` block to include a legal disclaimer or disclosure that is only required for a specific service or topic.
-   **Contact Information**: If a page is about a specific department or location, you could add a `Contact & Location` block with their direct contact details.

## Global vs. Local Footer

It's important to understand the distinction between the two footer types:

-   **Global Footer**: This is the main, site-wide footer managed under **Globals â†’ Site Config**. It contains the elements that appear on every page, such as your company logo, main navigation links, and copyright information. You rarely edit this.
-   **Local Footer Content**: This is the page-specific content you add in the **Footer Content** tab. It is unique to the entry you are editing and appears directly above the global footer.

By combining these two, you can maintain site-wide consistency while still providing highly relevant, contextual information on individual pages.
