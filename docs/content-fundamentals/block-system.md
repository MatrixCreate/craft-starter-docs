# Block System

*How Craft CMS uses content blocks for flexible page building*

Instead of a single text editor, Craft CMS uses a content block system for building pages. This approach lets you combine different types of content – text, images, forms, testimonials – in any order to create the exact layout you need.

## How It Works

Content blocks are added in the Content tab when editing entries. Each block type has specific fields and handles different kinds of content.

**Basic workflow:**
1. **Edit an entry** and go to the Content tab
2. **Add blocks** using the "Add Content Block" button
3. **Configure each block** with its specific content and settings
4. **Reorder blocks** by dragging them up or down

## Block Types

The system includes blocks for different content needs:

- **Text blocks** for formatted content with headings and paragraphs
- **Media blocks** for images and videos
- **Interactive blocks** for forms and FAQ sections
- **Display blocks** for testimonials and blog listings
- **Layout blocks** for text and image combinations

## Key Benefits

**Flexibility** – Create any page layout without coding

**Consistency** – Each block type maintains design standards

**Reusability** – Some blocks can use global content that appears across multiple pages

**Organization** – Content is structured and easy to manage

## Global vs Local Content

Many blocks offer the choice between global and local content:

- **Global content** is managed centrally and appears consistently across pages
- **Local content** is specific to individual pages

This system lets you maintain consistent messaging while allowing page-specific customization when needed.
