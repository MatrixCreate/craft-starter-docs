# Page Structure

*How pages are organized and the different content areas*

When editing any page in Craft CMS, you'll see multiple tabs across the top of the editing interface. Each tab controls a different aspect of your page, from the main content to SEO settings. Understanding what each tab does helps you create complete, well-optimized pages.

## Page Editing Tabs

Every page is divided into several organized sections, each with its own purpose.

## Content Tab

This is where you'll spend most of your time building the main body of your page.

The Content tab uses the block system to let you build flexible page layouts. You can add text blocks, images, testimonials, contact forms, and other content types in any order you need.

**What goes here:**
- **Main page content** – The primary information visitors come to read
- **Content blocks** – Text, images, calls-to-action, and interactive elements
- **Page-specific information** – Content that's unique to this particular page

**How it works:**
- Click "Add a block" to insert new content
- Drag blocks up and down to reorder them
- Each block has its own editing interface and design options
- Preview your changes to see how the page looks to visitors

## Hero

The Hero section creates the large header area that appears at the top of most pages.

Unlike content blocks, the hero section has a fixed structure designed specifically for page introductions. It typically includes a background image, headline, description, and call-to-action button.

**Hero components:**
- **Background image** – Large visual that sets the page mood
- **Headline** – Primary page title that draws attention
- **Description** – Supporting text that explains what the page offers
- **Call-to-action button** – Link that encourages visitor action
- **Mobile image** – Optional different image for smaller screens

**When to use heroes:**
- **Landing pages** – Create strong first impressions
- **Service pages** – Highlight what you offer
- **About pages** – Showcase your company personality
- **Homepage** – Welcome visitors with compelling visuals

## Card Details

This tab controls how your page appears when it's displayed as a card or preview on other parts of your site.

**Card elements:**
- **Card image** – Thumbnail that represents the page
- **Card title** – How the page title appears in listings
- **Card description** – Brief summary for previews
- **Card link text** – Custom text for "read more" links

**Where cards appear:**
- **Blog listings** – Recent posts displayed in grids
- **Related content sections** – Suggested pages at the end of articles
- **Homepage features** – Highlighted pages or services
- **Search results** – Internal site search results

## Footer Content

Add page-specific elements that appear in the footer area, separate from the site-wide footer.

**Footer content uses:**
- **Related links** – Links to similar pages or resources
- **Additional contact info** – Page-specific phone numbers or addresses
- **Legal disclaimers** – Information relevant to specific content
- **Special offers** – Promotions related to the page topic

**Global vs local footers:**
- **Global footer** – Site-wide information like copyright and main contact details
- **Local footer content** – Page-specific additions that appear above the global footer

## SEO Settings

Control how your page appears in search engines and social media shares.

### Basic SEO

**Meta title** – The clickable headline that appears in search results  
Should be descriptive and include important keywords, typically 50-60 characters.

**Meta description** – The snippet of text that appears under your title in search results  
Summarize the page content in 150-160 characters to encourage clicks.

### Social Media Cards

**Facebook/Open Graph** – How your page appears when shared on Facebook, LinkedIn, and other platforms  
**Twitter Cards** – Specific formatting for Twitter shares  
**Social image** – Custom image for social media previews

**Social media optimization:**
- Use compelling images that represent your content
- Write engaging descriptions that encourage sharing
- Include your brand elements for recognition

## Schema Markup

Structured data that helps search engines understand your content better.

**Schema types available:**
- **Organization** – Company information and contact details
- **Article** – Blog posts and news content
- **Service** – Business services and offerings
- **FAQ** – Question and answer content
- **Review** – Customer testimonials and ratings

**Benefits of schema markup:**
- **Rich snippets** – Enhanced search results with additional information
- **Better visibility** – Stand out in search results with structured data
- **Voice search optimization** – Help voice assistants find and read your content

## Page Organization and Hierarchy

### URL Structure

Pages can be organized in a hierarchy that affects both URLs and navigation.

**Parent pages** contain child pages, creating organized site sections:
- Services (parent)
  - Web Design (child)
  - SEO Services (child)
  - Content Marketing (child)

**URL benefits:**
- **Logical structure** – `/services/web-design/` is more organized than `/web-design/`
- **SEO advantages** – Search engines understand topic relationships
- **User navigation** – Visitors can edit URLs to move up the hierarchy

### Navigation and Breadcrumbs

**Main navigation** – Primary menu that appears on every page  
**Breadcrumbs** – "Home > Services > Web Design" trails that help users understand their location  
**Parent/child relationships** – Automatic connections between related pages

## Working with Page Structure

### Creating Complete Pages

**Start with content** – Focus on the main Content tab first to establish your key message.

**Add a compelling hero** – Create a strong first impression with the Hero tab.

**Optimize for search** – Use the SEO tab to ensure your page can be found.
