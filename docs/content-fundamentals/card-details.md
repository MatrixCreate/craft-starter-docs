# Card Details

The **Card Details** tab is a crucial part of content management that controls how a piece of content appears when it is featured as a "card" or preview in a list on another part of your website. Filling this out ensures your content is presented professionally and enticingly wherever it is promoted.

## Where Card Details Are Used

The information you provide in this tab is automatically used by various content blocks and features across the site, including:

-   **Blog Listing** blocks
-   **Entry Cards** blocks
-   Related content sections at the end of articles
-   Featured content grids on the Homepage

## Fields Explained

### Card Image

This is the thumbnail image that will represent your content in any list or grid. It's the most important visual element for grabbing a user's attention.

-   **Purpose**: To provide a compelling visual preview.
-   **Best Practice**: Choose an image that is clear, relevant to the topic, and eye-catching.

### Excerpt

This is a short, concise summary of your content. It appears alongside the Card Image to give users a snapshot of what the page is about.

-   **Purpose**: To provide a brief, engaging text preview.
-   **Dual Function for SEO**: This is a key time-saver. The text you write here is also used as the default **Meta Description** in the `SEO` tab. By writing a good excerpt, you are also creating the text that appears in Google search results, saving you from having to write it twice.
-   **Best Practice**: Write 1-2 sentences that accurately summarize the content and encourage users to click.

### Icon

This is an optional field that allows you to associate a small icon with your content. In certain designs or listing styles, this icon may be displayed on the card to provide an extra visual cue about the content type (e.g., a video play icon for a video post).

-   **Purpose**: To add a simple, symbolic visual indicator.
-   **Best Practice**: Use this field if your site's design specifically incorporates icons in its card layouts. Maintain consistency with icons used for similar content types.
