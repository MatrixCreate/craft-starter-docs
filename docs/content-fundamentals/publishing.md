# Publishing

*How to save, preview, and publish your content*

Publishing in Craft CMS gives you complete control over when and how your content goes live. You can save work as drafts, preview changes before publishing, and schedule content to go live at specific times. This workflow ensures you never accidentally publish incomplete content.

## Content States

Every piece of content exists in one of several states that determine its visibility to website visitors.

### Draft
**Content that's saved but not visible to visitors**

Draft content is perfect for work in progress. You can save your changes, preview how they'll look, and continue editing without affecting your live website.

**When to use drafts:**
- Working on new content that isn't ready to publish
- Making major changes to existing pages
- Collaborating with team members before going live
- Testing new content layouts or messaging

### Live
**Published content that visitors can see**

Live content appears on your website immediately. Once you publish content, it becomes visible to search engines and website visitors.

**Publishing makes content:**
- Visible to all website visitors
- Available to search engines for indexing
- Accessible through site navigation and internal links
- Part of your website's public content

### Disabled
**Temporarily hidden content that can be quickly restored**

Disabled content is published content that you've temporarily hidden from visitors. The content remains in the system but doesn't appear on your website.

**Use disabled status to:**
- Temporarily hide outdated information
- Remove seasonal content without deleting it
- Test changes by hiding and re-enabling content
- Quickly pull content that needs updates

### Pending
**Content scheduled to go live at a specific time**

Pending content is scheduled for future publication. You can write content in advance and have it automatically go live at the perfect time.

**Scheduling benefits:**
- Publish content when your audience is most active
- Coordinate launches with marketing campaigns
- Maintain consistent publishing schedules
- Work ahead during busy periods

## Saving Your Work

Craft CMS offers several ways to save your content, depending on what you want to do next.

### Save Options

**Save** – Saves your changes and returns you to the entry list  
Use this when you're finished editing and want to see all your content.

**Save and continue editing** – Saves changes but keeps the editing interface open  
Perfect when you want to save progress but continue working on the same content.

**Keyboard shortcuts:**
- **Ctrl+S (PC) or Cmd+S (Mac)** – Quick save
- **Ctrl+Shift+S (PC) or Cmd+Shift+S (Mac)** – Save and continue editing

### Auto-Save Protection

Craft CMS automatically saves your work in the background to prevent data loss. If your browser crashes or you accidentally navigate away, your recent changes are preserved.

**Auto-save features:**
- Saves every few minutes while you're actively editing
- Preserves content if your browser closes unexpectedly
- Shows a notification when auto-save occurs
- Recovers work when you return to editing

## Preview System

Before publishing content, you can preview exactly how it will look to visitors.

### Preview Options

**Preview in current tab** – See your content in the editing interface  
**Preview in new tab** – Open a full preview in a separate browser tab  
**Mobile preview** – See how your content looks on smaller screens

### Share Preview Links

Generate special links that let others see your draft content before it's published.

**Preview links allow:**
- Team members to review content before publication
- Clients to approve changes without CMS access
- Testing content on different devices and browsers
- Sharing work-in-progress for feedback

**Preview link features:**
- Temporary links that expire after a set time
- No login required for viewers
- Safe sharing without granting CMS access
- Perfect for client reviews and approvals

## Content Review and Collaboration

### Working with Teams

**Draft sharing** – Save content as drafts and share preview links for team review  
**Version control** – See when content was last modified and by whom  
**Collaborative editing** – Multiple team members can work on different sections

### Review Process

**Before publishing:**
1. **Complete all content** in draft status
2. **Share preview links** with relevant team members
3. **Gather feedback** and make necessary revisions  
4. **Final review** to ensure everything is correct
5. **Publish** when approved

### Version History

Track changes and see previous versions of your content.

**Version tracking shows:**

- Option to compare different versions

## Best Practices

### Content Workflow

**Plan before writing** – Outline your content structure before diving into details.

**Use drafts liberally** – Save early and often to protect your work.

**Preview thoroughly** – Check desktop and mobile previews before publishing.

**Schedule strategically** – Publish when your audience is most likely to see new content.

### Quality Control

**Proofread carefully** – Use preview mode to catch typos and formatting issues.

**Test all links** – Ensure internal and external links work correctly.

**Check images** – Verify that images load properly and look good on all devices.

**Review SEO settings** – Make sure meta titles and descriptions are complete.

### Team Collaboration

**Use consistent naming** – Develop naming conventions for drafts and scheduled content.

**Communicate changes** – Let team members know when you've updated shared content.

**Respect scheduling** – Don't change scheduled content without team coordination.
