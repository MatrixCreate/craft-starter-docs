# Global Content

*Manage reusable content blocks and site-wide elements*

The Global Content section provides centralized management for content that can be used across multiple pages through content blocks. When content blocks have global options enabled, they pull content from these sections.

## Using Global Content

### Global vs Local Content
Content blocks offer the choice between:
- **Global Content** – Centrally managed, consistent across all pages where used
- **Local Content** – Page-specific content that overrides global settings

### When to Use Global Content
- Standard company messaging that applies site-wide
- Consistent calls-to-action across multiple pages
- FAQ sections that don't vary by page
- Company USPs that apply universally
- Contact forms with standard fields and messaging

### Content Block Integration
Global content automatically appears in content blocks when:
- The "Use Global [Content Type]" toggle is enabled in the block
- Content editors don't need to recreate the same content repeatedly
- Updates to global content immediately reflect across all pages using it

*Global Content provides efficient content management through centralized control of reusable elements, ensuring consistency while allowing local customization when needed.*
