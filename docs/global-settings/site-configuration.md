# Site Configuration

**Site Configuration** is where you manage the technical settings and default behaviors that affect your entire website. These settings are typically configured by a developer during setup, but it's useful for content editors to understand what's controlled here, as they influence how your content is displayed and how the site functions.

You can find these settings under **Globals â†’ Site Config** in the main sidebar.

## Configuration Tabs Overview

### Header & Footer

This tab controls the behavior and appearance of your site's main header and footer areas.

-   **Sticky Header**: Toggles whether the header remains fixed at the top of the screen as users scroll down.
-   **Hide Header on Scroll**: A smart feature that hides the header when scrolling down to maximize screen space, and reveals it when scrolling up.
-   **Footer Content**: Manages the global content and links that appear in the very bottom section of every page.

### Navigation

This section manages the overall behavior of your site's navigation menus, including advanced features like megamenus.

-   **Megamenu Configuration**: Settings for enhanced dropdown menus that can display rich content, multiple columns, or featured links.
-   **Auto-hide Navigation**: Similar to the header, this can control whether the main navigation automatically hides or shows based on scroll direction.
-   **Mobile Navigation**: Defines how the navigation behaves and appears on smaller screens, such as mobile phones and tablets.

### Content Blocks

This tab contains global settings that apply to all content blocks used across your site. These are often default styling or behavior options.

-   **Default Styling**: Sets the default appearance for various content blocks, ensuring visual consistency.
-   **Global Color Scheme**: Defines the primary and secondary colors used throughout your site, which content blocks can then inherit.
-   **Default Images/Placeholders**: Specifies fallback images or default content for blocks if specific content isn't provided.

### Placeholders

This tab is dedicated to managing default content and fallback options for your site. These are used when specific content (like an image) is missing from an entry.

-   **Default Images**: Upload images that will be used as placeholders across the site if no specific image is assigned.
-   **Fallback Text**: Define default text snippets that can be used when content fields are empty.

### Scripts

This tab is primarily for developers to add custom code snippets to your website, such as analytics tracking codes or third-party integrations.

-   **Custom HTML**: Allows for injecting custom HTML into the `<head>` or `<body>` of your website.
-   **Analytics/Tracking Codes**: Integrates tools like Google Analytics or other marketing tracking scripts.
