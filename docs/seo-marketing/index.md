## SEO Management Approach

### Automated Optimization
The SEOmatic plugin automatically generates meta titles, descriptions, and structured data based on content, reducing manual SEO work while maintaining optimization standards.

### Global Templates
Site-wide SEO settings provide consistent defaults across all content types, with automatic generation of social media tags, meta descriptions, and technical SEO elements.

### Page-Level Control
Individual entries include an SEO tab for customization and overrides when specific pages require unique optimization approaches.

### Schema Integration  
Structured data markup is automatically generated based on content type and can be customized through schema settings for enhanced search engine understanding.
