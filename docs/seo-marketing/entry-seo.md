# Entry SEO Settings

**Entry SEO** is the final and most specific layer of your site's SEO controls. This is where you, as a content editor, have the most power to influence a single entry's search engine appearance. The settings you apply here will override any default rules set in both **Global SEO** and **Content SEO**.

These controls are found in the **SEO** tab when you are editing any individual entry (whether it's a Page, a Blog post, or any other content type).

## Fine-Tuning a Single Entry

This is where you can make specific adjustments to optimize a high-priority page. The most common fields you will use are:

-   **SEO Title**: While the system automatically generates a title based on global or content-specific rules, you can write your own here. This is useful if the default title is too long or not compelling enough. For example, you might change a title from "About Us | Company Name" to "Our Mission: Learn About the Team at Company Name" to be more descriptive.
-   **Meta Description**: This is the short paragraph of text that appears under your page's title in Google search results. Writing a compelling, relevant description (around 150-160 characters) is crucial for encouraging users to click on your link instead of a competitor's.
-   **SEO Image**: The system will likely use the entry's "Featured Image" for social media sharing. However, if you want a different image to appear when this specific page is shared on Facebook or X (Twitter), you can upload a custom one here.

## The SEO Preview

One of the most useful features in the SEO tab is the live preview. As you type in the `SEO Title` and `Meta Description` fields, the **Google Search Preview** at the top of the page will update in real-time. This shows you exactly how your entry will look in search results, helping you craft the perfect, attention-grabbing snippet.

## The Complete SEO Hierarchy

Remember, the three layers work together to give you both automation and control:

1.  **Global SEO** (Lowest Priority): Broad, site-wide default rules.
2.  **Content SEO**: Templates for specific content types (e.g., all Blog posts).
3.  **Entry SEO** (Highest Priority): Your manual settings for one specific entry. What you enter here wins.

By understanding this hierarchy, you can let the system automate most of your SEO work and focus your energy on fine-tuning the pages that matter most.
